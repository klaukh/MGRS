# MGRS
### Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) Shapefiles

Run `make` on a cloned directory to generate worldwide label centroids and outlines of MGRS Grid Zone Designators (GZDs, e.g., "60Z") and 100km zones (e.g., 60ZDA) polygons.

Requires `python 3.6+`, a compatible installation of `7-zip`, `gzip`, `GDAL`, `OGR`, and `make`. This repository was created and tested on Windows with an eye torwards Linux portability provided minimal adjustments.
